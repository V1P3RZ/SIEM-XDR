# SIEM-XDR

Implementation of Open Source SIEM and XDR Solution using Wazuh

Description: This project focuses on deploying an open-source Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) and Extended Detection and Response (XDR) solution leveraging Wazuh. Wazuh, a robust security platform, offers advanced intrusion detection, log management, and regulatory compliance features for IT environments. The goal is to fortify system security by establishing a comprehensive threat detection and monitoring solution. Through this report, we detail the methodology employed to implement the SIEM and XDR solution, emphasizing Wazuh's key capabilities in intrusion detection, event correlation, log management, and regulatory compliance. Additionally, we assess the effectiveness of the solution by simulating attacks on Wazuh-monitored agents, analyzing results, and exploring potential enhancements to further strengthen system security.
